# Jed Guzelkabaagac

I am an MSc student in **Mathematics in Data Science** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and a research scholar with the Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI).  

My research interests include **generative models, robustness, uncertainty estimation, and graph learning**, with applications to scientific discovery.
