excerpt: "Investigating JEPA pretraining on point clouds to improve grasp success in low-label regimes."
---

On the DLR–Hand II platform, we applied JEPA pretraining to spatially sequenced point clouds. Compared to training from scratch, JEPA reduced validation top-logit RMSE by 7–25% in low-label regimes and improved coverage metrics.
